# Single Cycle MIPS ISA 32-bit Processor Implementation in VHDL

## Introduction
This project is a Single Cycle MIPS ISA 32-bit Processor Implementation. It is implemented using VHDL. MIPS (Microprocessor without Interlocked Pipelined Stages) is a reduced instruction set computer (RISC) instruction set architecture (ISA).

## Features
- **Word Size**: Each word in this processor is a 32-bit.
- **Memory Data Address**: The memory data address ranges from 4 to 19.
- **Instruction Memory Address**: The instruction memory address ranges from 1 to 16.
- **Memory Size**: Each memory size is 16*32.
- **Register File**: The register file consists of 32 registers.
